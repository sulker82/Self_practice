Agenda:

    - Review software testing intro
    - Review Static & Dynamic testing

    - New topic:
      Level of testings
        - Level 1: Unit testing
        - Level 2: Integration testing
        - Level 3: System testing
        - Level 4: User Acceptance testing(UAT)

      White, Black, Gray box testings
=================================
What needs to be tested during the SDLC? what is the testing approach? who performs testings?

- Documents ==> manually ==> static testing ==> The client, The business team, designers

- Code ==> automation ==> Dynamic testing ==> the Developers

- Software ==> manually & automatically ==> SDET, performance testers



What is Static testing?

- testing the documents , no code

- Review , Walk-through, inspection

What is Dynamic testing?

- testing the code & the software

- 4 levels:
        - Level 1: Unit testing
        - Level 2: Integration testing
        - Level 3: System testing
        - Level 4: User Acceptance testing(UAT)


Level 1: Unit testing

- testing a small unit / module of the application

- Developer's test the app's unit from the code prospective


Level 2: Integration testing

- Testing several related units/modules to see the data integration

- Developers perform the Integration testing


Level 3: System testing

- Test the software itself

- Functional testing : SDET ==> manually & automatically ==> UI, DB, API testing

- Non - functional testing : Performance testers ==> manually & automatically


Level 4: User Acceptance testing(UAT)

- make a evaluation if the software is acceptable to release

- UAT - Alpha testing : UAT team --> test the software to evaluate if the software is acceptable

- UAT - Beta testing: The client "test" the app to evaluate if the software is acceptable


White box testing?

- test the app with very good knowledge for the application internal code

- Unit & Integration testings

Black box testing?

- test the app without any technical knowledge, without knowing the application internal code

- manual tester, the client, end users



Gray box testing?

- test the app with partial knowledge to the app's internal code structure

- automation engineers perform testings with partial knowledge
