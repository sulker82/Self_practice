Today's class agenda:

     - Review the SDLC
     - Review the environments

     - Software testing intro
     - Testing level in general

Questions to learn:

- What is software testing?

   - software testing is a process to confirm the quality of a software and prevent bugs, reduce costs, improve the perfoamnce.

- What is to be tested in SDLC process?

   - Documents
   - Code

   - Manually
   - Automatically


- Who performs testing?

   - Each step of SDLC requires perform testings, and different people test the different objects

     Business Team + Designers + Client ---> Doc

     Developers ---> code

     SDET + performance testers --> software itself

     Client + End users --> software before the release


--------------------------------------------
- Testing types in general during the SDLC?

     1. Static testing

     2. Dynamic testing

--------------------------------------------
- What is static testing?

    - testing documents is called static testing

    - It is also called -> Verification process: prepare a doc -> test / check the doc -> get final correct doc.

- how to perform the static testing? how to test documents?

    - Review

    - Walk - through

    - Inspection

---------------------------------------
- What is dynamic testing?

    - Testing the code & the software is called dynamic testing.

     - It is also called -> Validation process: developers write code + test it --> test the software + evaluate the quality
