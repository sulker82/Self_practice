Grooming:

Before : The PO has to prepare several US under the PB.

During : The PO explains the US & the dev team ask Q.
         The dev team & The po -->  Assign points / Estimate the size of US

         Fibonacci numbers : 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 ==> 1 point == 1 day


Sprint Planning: Select / pull exact US/Task from the PB into the SB --> based on the team
 capacity & DOR criteria.

   1. SM creates a SB + with the Sprint number, Starting & ending date
   2. SM helps the team to calculate the team capacity --> total work availability
         team capacity == total US points we can complete in a sprint


   3. The PO starts to pull the US from the OB into the SB

   4. the SM or PO, starts the sprint by clicking "start sprint" button in jira


   5. Optional: team lead assign US to the members
                every take a US to work on
